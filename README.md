# decode_gestures_deep_learning
The right place to be if you still cannot understand the gestures of southern europeans. I always got this problem with my firneds, so i decided to train a model to explain to them what we are saying without saying it ;)

Innitially trained for four gestures; but I will add more.

Enjoy!
