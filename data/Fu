A bras d'honneur (French for "arm of honor"), Iberian slap, Italian salute,
or Kozakiewicz's gesture is an obscene gesture that communicates moderate to extreme contempt, 
and is roughly equivalent in meaning to "fuck you",
"shove it up your ass/arse", or "go fuck yourself", having the same meaning as giving the finger.
